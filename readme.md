# C Template

Template for a simply embedded application written in C and tested with Catch2

## Goal

Create a C template for an embedded project.  It should work well with at least Windows and linux, and require minimal setup from the user of the template.

We can use a makefile to provide a minimal interface for building from the command line that can be used by both github actions and pre-commit
